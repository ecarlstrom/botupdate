1. ~~As of 11/28/2020, there seems to be an issue with dependencies or the Discord wrapper that causes Youtube data to be improperly retrieved and results in playback issues. Currently working to find the source of this problem. (UPDATE: looks like this is fixed now, will keep an eye on it)~~

2. Working on making sure volume is properly normalized over an entire queue until a change is made.

3. `!listnames` command should avoid wrapping into a new embed if last line is cut off.
